- session.name: Using the default session cookie name can open your app to attacks.
- session.keys: The list of keys to use to sign & verify cookie values, or a configured Keygrip instance. Set cookies are always signed with keys[0], while the other keys are valid for verification, allowing for key rotation. If a Keygrip instance is provided, it can be used to change signature parameters like the algorithm of the signature.
- session.saveUninitialized: Forces a session that is "uninitialized" to be saved to the store. A session is uninitialized when it is new but not modified. Choosing false is useful for implementing login sessions, reducing server storage usage, or complying with laws that require permission before setting a cookie. Choosing false will also help with race conditions where a client makes multiple parallel requests without a session.
- HTTPonly: ensures that a cookie is not accessible using the JavaScript code. This is the most crucial form of protection against cross-scripting attacks.
- secure:  ensures that the browser will reject cookies unless the connection happens over HTTPS.
- sameSite:  improves cookie security and avoids privacy leaks:
By default, sameSite was initially set to none (sameSite = None). This allowed third parties to track users across sites. Currently, it is set to Lax (sameSite = Lax) meaning a cookie is only set when the domain in the URL of the browser matches the domain of the cookie, thus eliminating third partyâ€™s domains. sameSite can also be set to Strict (sameSite = Strict). This will restrict cross-site sharing even between different domains that the same publisher owns.
